### Why?
We githubers have accumulated a lot of knowledge over the years, wouldn't it be nice of us to hand this knowledge over to the next generations?

I hope this could be a collaborative space where we all kind of information that would be interesting such all those awesome-* lists, guides, blogposts, you name it.

### What can I do?
 - Create a pull-request when you want to add something
 - Create an issue when a link is broken
 
Let's make this happen! <3
